    "In this notebook we explore different approach to overcome one of the main limitation of BERT (which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), the ability to process long document. In fact BERT can only be applied on text that have less than 512 token after tokenization with the Bert Tokenizer.\n",

    "This notebook was written as a requirement for our Master's Pluridisciplinary Project (PPD). It is an adaptation of the Medium article [Using BERT For Classifying Documents with Long Texts](https://medium.com/@armandj.olivares/using-bert-for-classifying-documents-with-long-texts-5c3e7b04573d), which is an implementation of [this paper, which introduce a new method to deal with Long Documents : RoBERT (Recurrence over BERT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10781).\n",

    "We also went a step further and took the decision to implement [this paper, which introduce diferents methods to deal with Long Documents and BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05583) to see if the RoBERT paper bring some significative improvement on the classification of Long Texts with BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduce 2 main approaches, the **Truncation methods** and the **Hierarchical methods** :\n",
    " * Truncation methods\n",
    "   * head-only\n",
    "   * tail-only\n",
    "   * head+tail\n",
    " * Hierarchical methods\n",
    "   * mean pooling\n",
    "   * max pooling\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",

    "The goal of the original RoBERT article was to solve the following problem: BERT has a fixed input token count; how can we use its power on long texts, in that article, the Tensorflow version of BERT was used. This notebook implements the same approach using HuggingFace's `transformers` library and `pytorch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used is the *US Consumer Finance Complaints* available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cfpb/us-consumer-finance-complaints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the article goes follows:\n",
    "1. Read the data and do some basic preprocessing\n",
    "2. Break the documents into smaller segments with a number of tokens that can be handled by BERT\n",
    "3. Fine-tune BERT on those segments using a classification head\n",
    "4. Combine the segments of each document by using an LSTM. The fixed output size of the LSTM can be used by a single fully connected layer for the final classification.\n",

    "### 1. Preprocessing:\n",
    "In this part, we did not modify the code provided in the Medium article. The preprocessing step goes as follows:\n",
    "1. Remove all documents with fewer than 250 tokens. We want to concentrate only on long texts\n",
    "2. Consolidate the classes by combining those that are similar. (e.g.: \"Credit card\" or \"prepaid card\" complaints) :\n",
    " * Credit reporting‘ to ‘Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumerreports‘.\n",
    " * ‘Credit card‘ to ‘Credit card or prepaid card‘.\n",
    " * ‘Payday loan‘ to ‘Payday loan, title loan or personal loan‘1\n",
    " * ‘Virtual currency‘ to ‘Money transfer, virtual currency or money servic\n",
    "3. Remove all non-word characters\n",
    "4. Encode the labels\n",
    "5. Split the dataset in train set (80%) and validation set (20%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Segmentation and tokenization:\n",
    "First, each complaint is split into 200-token chunk with an overlap of 50 between each of them. This means that the last 50 tokens of a segment are the first 50 of the next segment.  \n",
    "Then, each segment is tokenized using BERT's tokenizer. This is needed for two main reasons:\n",
    "1. BERT's vocabulary is not made of just English words, but also subwords and single characters\n",
    "2. BERT does not take raw string as inputs. It needs:\n",
    "    - token ids: those values allow BERT to retrieve the tensor representation of a token\n",
    "    - input mask: a tensor of 0s and 1s that shows whether a token should be ignored (0) or not (1) by BERT\n",
    "    - segment ids: those are used to tell BERT what tokens form the first sentence and the second sentence (in the next sentence prediction task)  \n",
    "This is achieved by first converting the segments into `bert.run_classifier.InputExample` objects that are then converted into features BERT can understand by the utility function `bert.run_classifier.convert_examples_to_features`. Here the parameter `MAX_SEQ_LENGTH` ensures that any tokenized sentence longer that that number (200 in this case) will be truncated.  \n",
    "Each returned segment is given the same class as the document containing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch offers the `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes that make it easier to group the data reading and preparation operations while decreasing the memory usage in case the dataset is large.  \n",
    "We implemented the above steps in the `Custom_Dataset_Class.py` file. Our dataset class `ConsumerComplaintsDataset1` has a constructor (`__init__`) taking the necessary parameters to load the .csv file, segment the documents, and then tokenize them. It also preprocesses the data as explained in the preprocessing section.    \n",
    "The two other important methods are the following:\n",
    "- `__len__` returns the number of documents\n",
    "- `__getitem__` is the method where most of the work is done. It takes a tensor of idx values and returns the tokenized data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As said above, there is differents approaches for overflowing tokens, we added the differents strategies (described in [the following paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05583)) via the use of the parameter `approach` in the initialisation of Consumer Complaints Dataset class, here is the differents value of the `approach` parameter to handle that situation :\n",
    "        - **all**: overflowing tokens from a document are used to create new 200 token chunk with 50 tokens overlap between them\n",
    "        - **head**: overflowing tokens are truncated. Only the first 200 tokens are used.\n",
    "        - **tail**: only the last 200 tokens are kept."
